# TouchNGo-Schedule-Data-
Working at a soccer training facility, we offer numerous different classes that vary by level and age. I was tasked with counting the number of times we offer specific classes based off of a new schedule the company had been working on implementing. I took this opportunity to present my ability to visualize and compare data by visualizing information from our potential and present schedules. This analysis provided insight into any changes in class availability and distribution. 

Python Libraries used:
- MatPlotLib: Visualizing information through the use of Pie charts and Bar charts.
- NumPy: Positioning the Data on the visualized charts correctly.

Conclusions:
By analzing the visualized data on the past and upcoming class schedules, the company can now determine if adjustments to the new schedule are necessary. These decisions are also made based on additional data collected on participation trends (such as client age, client level, client return rate, high participation class times, low participation class times, etc...). Through the use of the visualized data on the past and upcoming schedules, the company can now clearly determine whether their new schedule will effectively maximize participation rates based on participation trends they have previously acknowledged.
