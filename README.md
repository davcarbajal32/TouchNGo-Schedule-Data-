# TouchNGo-Schedule-Data-
Working at a soccer training facility, we offer numerous different classes that vary by level and age.

Python Libraries used:
- MatPlotLib: Visualizing information through the use of Pie charts and Bar charts.
- NumPy: Positioning the Data on the visualized charts correctly.

Conclusions:
